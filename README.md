# PHARE  
PHARE is a bioinformatics tool for predicting the immune age of samples from scRNA-seq data or bulk RNA-seq data.

## Web Tool
We have developed a website that can be easily used. See [https://xiazlab.org/phare](https://xiazlab.org/phare) for more information.

## Quick start in python
Or start using PHARE directly from the code:

1. Create a python enviroment and install dependent packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Run `predict_one_sample.py` to realize a prediction from scRNA-seq data. 

3. Run `predict_one_bulk_sample.py` to try prediction from bulk RNA-seq data.
